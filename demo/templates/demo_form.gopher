{% extends "layout.gopher" %}
{% block body %}
This is an example of an HTML style multi-part form that uses strict
gopher RFC 1436. Form fields are input using regular gopher searches
and are saved in the page's URL query string.

Submitting the form on this page won't actually do anything, so feel
free to play around with it!
